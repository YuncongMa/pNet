</p>

* This toolbox is designed to extract personalized functional networks from fMRI data using spatial-regularized non-negative matrix factorization (**NMF**) method (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.05.004) <br />
* It works with both MATLAB (https://github.com/YuncongMa/pNet/tree/main/MATLAB_Old) and Python (https://github.com/YuncongMa/pNet/tree/main/Python), and comes with a user-friendly GUI interface in MATLAB, as well as a step-by-step guide to setup a customized workflow script in Python.<br />
* It supports both surface and volume based fMRI data, as well as the grayordinate which combines the two types. <br />
* It supports multiple fMRI formats, including CIFTI, MGH, MGZ, NIFTI, and MAT.<br />
* It supports multi-cohort datasets and precomputed group-level FNs.<br />


# GUI
The MATLAB version features an intuitive user interface (/MATLAB/GUI/pNet.mlapp) to configure the workflow, carry out the computation and check the results. <br />

# Sever mode
pNet provides bash scripts to interact with server environment for both MATLAN and Python versions. The server mode in Python version is recommended for easier use. <br />
The MATLAB version uses bash scripts (/MATLAN/Bash_Script) to perform customized pNet workflows. Users need to submit those bash jobs using terminal commands. <br />
The Python version uses a Python script to generate bash scripts and submit bash jobs to the server.

# Modules and workflow
pNet consists of five main modules and a customizable workflow.

</p>


* Data input module loads preprocessed fMRI data, with corresponding brain template files to extract coordination information and facilitate visualization. 
* FN computation module is to carry out computation for group-level and personalized FNs. 
* Visualization module can provide both preconfigured and interative displays
* Quality control module will ensure the reliability of the whole computation. 
* Additionally, statistical analyses can be employed to investigate differences in personalized FNs between groups or their relation to behavioral traits.



# Data Structure
pNet organizes data structure with respect to the six panels of its GUI version: Data Input, FN Computation, Group FN, Personalized FN, Statistics, Quality Control.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/YuncongMa/pNet/assets/20191790/acfb3332-fb96-4458-98be-fde971c2836d" width="800">
</p>


* Each folder contains setting files, data, or figure files.
* Group FNs and corresponding preconfigured visualization files are in Group_FN.
* Perosnalized FNs of each subject or fMRI scan are stored in sub-folders in Personalized_FN.


# Brain Template
Five built-in brain templates are available in the subfolder "Brain_Template".
1. HCP surface: subfolder "HCP_Surface". It contains 3D mesh shapes (vertices and faces) and brain masks for two hemishperes.
2. FreeSurfer fsaverage5: "FreeSurfer_fsaverage5". It is similar to HCP surface .
3. MNI volume space: subfolder "MNI_Volume". It contains two MATLAB files "Brain_Mask.mat" and "Overlay_Image.mat".
4. HCP surface-volume: It contains both cortical surface information, and subcortical volume.
5. HCP volume: It is similar to MNI volume space.


# Precomputed gFNs
pNet can load precomputed gFNs as reference to obtain personalized FNs for individual fMRI data. <br />
Here we provided 17 FN results (/Group_FN/HCP_Surface/gFN_17_HCP_Surface.mat) for HCP S1200, and 17 FN results for UKBB (/Group_FN/UKBB_Volume/gFN_17_UKBB_Volume.mat). <br />
More precomputed gFNs will come in future release.


# Example
We provided results of three examples for users to learn how to run the pFN computation, and navigate through the precomputed results. For each example, we provides examples of simulated fMRI data, and precomputed results of real fMRI data. Examples can be accessed on Google Drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1xkCy-0WqYvPA9ooq8txTdc0GsGC-YXMq?usp=share_link.   <br />

1.	HCP surface data. (2 subject, 2 scans per subject, 400 volumes per scan) in .mat format. Precomputed results of 10 subject data are stored in subfolder "Test_FN17".
2.	PNC surface data (2 subject, 1 scan per subject, 300 volumes per scan) in .mgh format. Precomputed results of 10 subject data are stored in subfolder "Test_FN17".
3.	UKBB volume data (2 subject, 1 scan per subject, 200 volumes per scan) in .nii.gz format. Precomputed results of 10 subject data are stored in subfolder "Test_FN17".


The data organization is as below.

# Quality Control
Personalized FN modeling methods will enhance the functional homogeneity (ex. average functional connectivity with each network) with functional networks, suggesting better functional representation. <br />
pNet generates a file report for the examination about the one-to-one match between gFNs and pFNs, with another figure about the spatial correspondence.

# Web report
pNet generates a HTML based web report to check gFNs, all pFNs with hyperlinks, and quality control.

# Installation
1. The MATLAB version requires MATLAB no older than 2021A. Its GUI version can be accessed by openning pNet.mlapp, or install the pNet.mlappinstall into MATLAB APPS. Compiled pNet is located in folder Compiled_Runtime. It requires the free MATLAB runtime software at https://www.mathworks.com/products/compiler/matlab-runtime.html. Details can be found in the README.txt in each subfolder containing the compiled pNet.
2. The Python version is available at https://github.com/YuncongMa/pNet/tree/main/Python.
3. Additional installation information can be found in the help document (Help_Document.pdf).


# Hardware requirement
It is recommended to run pNet with CPU at least 4 cores, memory (RAM) at least 16GB, and free disk storage at least 10GB. Large dataset and parallel computation will require more CPU cores, memory space, and disk space. CPU and memory inf, as well as estimated memory usage can be found in the parallel section.The pNet UI requires screen displaying resolution at least 1280x960. It is recommended to use an external montior with reosolution at least 1920x1080. 2k and 4k displays are desirable.


# MATLAB and system Compatibility
Note: it is recommended to run pNet as a MATLAB APP to allow for maximum compatibility. Although we are striving for maximizing the compatibility of pNet on different MATLAB versions and operation systems, it is difficult to conduct comprehensive tests on all cases. Our primary test environment is MATLAB 2022B and macOS Ventura 13.
