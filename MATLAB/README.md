# This is a brief introduction of the MATLAB version
The MATLAB version offers both GUI and scripts.

## GUI
The MATLAB version features an intuitive user interface (/MATLAB/GUI/pNet.mlapp) to configure the workflow, carry out the computation and check the results. <br />

(A) The data input module for loading fMRI scans and brain template files. <br />
(B) A module to setup computation parameters of our spatial-reguarlized NMF method. <br />
(C) Surface-based visualization of both group and personalized FNs (k=17) using HCP S1200 dataset, with left panel showing a binarized atlas generated from the group FNs and the right panel showing five views of three personalized FNs. All the color bars of intensity maps were set from the maximum value of the map to its half value. <br />
(D) Volume-based visualization of both group and personalized FNs (k=17) from Zhenâ€™s multi-cohort iSTAGING study, with left panel showing a binarized functional atlas generated from the group FNs and the right panel showing a three-slice view of three personalized FNs. <br />
(E) Surface-based visualization of a personalized FN. <br />
(F) Surface-based visualization of the maximum t value (two sample t-test, FDR correction, p-value=0.001) of sex differences of individualized FNs (k=50) of the HCP S1200 dataset. <br />
(G) A module for quality control, showing one scan with two FNs mismatched to their group-level counterparts. <br />
